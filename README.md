# Classification of Perennial Plants Using K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)


## Classification Using KNN and Confusion Matrix:

The Iris Dataset will be utilized for classifying perennial plants based on their sepal width, sepal length, petal width, and petal length.
The K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm will be applied, and a confusion matrix will be generated to evaluate model performance.
### Normalization:

Data normalization will be performed to ensure that all features contribute equally to the distance calculation.
Genre and Popularity Prediction for Music Dataset

### Data Preprocessing:

The “name,” “year,” and “artist” columns will be removed from the music dataset.
The “popularity” column will be split into five sections (e.g., low, moderate, high, very high, extremely high).

### Quantification and One-Hot Encoding:

A new column called “new_genre” will be created.
Genres will be quantified using one-hot encoding, representing each genre as a binary vector.

### Data Features’ Distribution:

The distribution of features in the dataset will be visualized to gain insights.
Normalization and Correlations:

Feature normalization will be applied, and correlations between different features will be explored.

### Data Splitting:

The data will be split into training, validation, and test sets.
KNN Algorithm:

The KNN algorithm will be employed to predict genres based on the features.
Hyperparameters will be tuned to find the best model in terms of accuracy.

### Reporting Genres:

The most and least frequent genres in the dataset will be reported.
