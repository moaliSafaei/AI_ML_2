Another example of machine learning (K-nearest neighbor example).

Classification example of perennial plants based on their superficial characteristics (Iris Dataset)
The dataset includes 5 columns. 4 of them are plant's characteristics (Sepal Width, Sepal Length,Petal Width, Petal Length). The fifth column are labels. 
For this model jaccard score, precision score, recall score are derived. 
demands of question are listed below:

1- classification of dataset using KNN and creating "confusion matrix".
2- Using "Normalization" and applying demands of last question.


"Genre" and "Popularity" prediction (musics Dataset)
Dataset includes 16 columns.
demands of question are listed below:

1- Removing "name", "year" and "artist" columns. Splitting "popularity" column into 5 setions.
2- Quantification of inputs and ouputs, creating new column named "new_genre", Detecting different genres and quantifying them (one hot encoding method) by a vector.
3- Demonstration data features' distribution.
4- "Normalization" of dataset and demonstrating correltions between different features.
5- Splitting Data into "training", "validation" and "test". 
6- Applying KNN algorithm and reporting the best model (based on accuracy) with its parameters.
7- Reporting the most and the least frequent genres.
